When there is time we dive into Next.js and Gatsby, its differences and how to achieve a simple website with one of these libraries. When there is even more time (might not be the case) we will talk about React‚Äôs server components which are yet in research.\n\nThe goal of this workshop is to understand how SSR works in React and how to improve it."

Both expose self-documenting APIs and are completely decoupled from each other.\n          \nTo demo this approach, we'll create a simple Toggler component (a UI component that allows going back and forth in an array of values).\n          \nTowards the end, we'll explore the benefits, focusing on testing these decoupled units in isolation.",

It's time to have a break and rethink our tools rather than going faster and faster in the same direction. It's time to redesign the Developer eXperience. It's time for a bundle-free dev environment.
