When there is time we dive into Next.js and Gatsby, its differences and how to achieve a simple website with one of these libraries. When there is even more time (might not be the case) we will talk about React‚Äôs server components which are yet in research.\n\nThe goal of this workshop is to understand how SSR works in React and how to improve it.",

Both expose self-documenting APIs and are completely decoupled from each other.\n          \nTo demo this approach, we'll create a simple Toggler component (a UI component that allows going back and forth in an array of values).\n          \nTowards the end, we'll explore the benefits, focusing on testing these decoupled units in isolation.",

Usually, as the applications grow, the complexity of interaction between different parts of the application compounds. The more you need those isolated parts to talk, the higher the level of complexity. Usually, the common pitfalls of these communications are underestimated especially with the recent trend of State management that tends to keep the application state outside of React and distributed. In this talk, We'll see how the Actor Model architecture can come to the rescue and what makes it stand out compared to the other approaches.",

In the meantime, we moved a lot of computation tasks to the client-side thanks to PWA and JavaScript Hegemony.\n\nSo we made Webapps for years, developing with awesome reactive frameworks and bundling a lot of dependencies. We progressively moved from our simplicity to complex apps toolchains. We've become the new Java-like ecosystem. It sucks.\n          \nIt's 2021, we've got a lot of new technologies to sustain our Users eXperience. It's time to have a break and rethink our tools rather than going faster and faster in the same direction. It's time to redesign the Developer eXperience. It's time for a bundle-free dev environment. It's time to embrace a new frontend building philosophy, still with our lovely JavaScript.\n          \nIntroducing Snowpack, Vite, Astro, and other Bare Modules tools concepts!",

For ambitious high-growth businesses, going global is not \"if\" but \"when\" so it's important to recognize the importance of localization, especially in large multi-team projects. This discussion will explore the depths of localization in Agile companies and what can be achieved with a Continuous Localization system. I'll share some common issues we faced with multi-language products and how localization automation helped us to scale the process across many product teams within the company.",
